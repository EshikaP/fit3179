           <h1>Analysis of Road Accidents in New Zealand</h1>
           <div class="description description-centre">
              <p>This page explores the trends in the road accidents in New Zealand over the years 2000 to 2018. It will then look more closely into the road accidents in 2018. It will investigate if there is any relationship between road accdients and the local government area or type of vehicle. As well as if the number of road accidents will change according to the speed limit and traffic controls, or weather or day lighting.  </p>

               <p>The line chart below on the left shows the trend of the number of road accidents yearly from 2000 to 2018. <span style="color: deeppink; font-weight: bold;">An annotation for 2007 is added, as this was the year which had the highest number of road accidents.</span> Further, the trend of the Total Number of Casualties can be explored looking at the stacked area chart on the right.</p>

We can see majority of the casualities are minor injuries.

               <p>A map of New Zealand has been provided below to investigate where the cluster of road accidents occur, and the severity of those road accidents using a colour scale. A zoom scroll bar has been provided as well as a drop down selection to focus on busier areas of New Zealand. <span style="color: #FF5733; font-weight: bold;"> Such as Auckland and Wellington, which seem to have a cluster of number of road accidents, indicating these are high risk zones.</span> This information can be useful to identify where stricter road safety measures need to be placed to increase road safety.</p>

Additonally below there are two dot charts. The dot chart on the left includes all vehicles types and the number of road accidents the vehicle was in. <span style="color: #7F461B; font-weight: bold;"> As annotated 'car' have the highest number of accidents by far, just as seen in the pie chart.</span> </p>
              <p>Hence, the dot chart on the right filters out 'car', and focuses on the other vehicles to more closely compare the number of road accidents they are in. <span style="color: #66A61E; font-weight: bold;"> As annotated 'trucks' have the second highest number of accidents. </span> To interact with these two charts, click on any of the points representitive of a vehcile to directly compare with the same point on the chart beside it.</p>
